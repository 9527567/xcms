\title{Extract (MS2) spectra associated with features}
\usage{
featureSpectra(x, msLevel = 2, expandRt = 0, expandMz = 0, ppm = 0,
  skipFilled = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\link{XCMSnExp} object with feature defitions available.}

\item{msLevel}{`integer(1)` defining whether MS1 or MS2 spectra should be
returned. Currently only `msLevel = 2` is supported.}

\item{expandRt}{`numeric(1)` to expand the retention time range of each
peak by a constant value on each side.}

\item{expandMz}{`numeric(1)` to expand the m/z range of each peak by a
constant value on each side.}

\item{ppm}{`numeric(1)` to expand the m/z range of each peak (on each side)
by a value dependent on the peak's m/z.}

\item{skipFilled}{`logical(1)` whether no spectra for filled-in peaks should
be reported.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed along to \code{\link[=chromPeakSpectra]{chromPeakSpectra()}},
such as \code{method}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list}, same length than there are
features in \code{x}, each element being a \code{list} of \linkS4class{Spectrum2}
objects with the MS2 spectra that potentially represent ions measured
by each chromatographic peak associated with the feature, or \code{NULL}
if none present.
}
\description{
Return MS2 spectra for all chromatographic peaks associated with the features
in \code{x}.
}
\details{
The function identifies all MS2 spectra with their precursor m/z within the
m/z range as well as their retention time within the rt range of each
chromatographic peak associated with the feature.

The optional parameter \code{method} allows to ensure that for each
chromatographic peak in one sample only one MS2 spectrum is returned.
See \link{chromPeakSpectra} for more details.
