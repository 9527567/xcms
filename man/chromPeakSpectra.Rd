\title{Extract (MS2) spectra associated with chromatographic peaks}
\usage{
chromPeakSpectra(x, msLevel = 2L, expandRt = 0, expandMz = 0,
  ppm = 0, method = c("all", "closest_rt", "closest_mz", "signal"),
  skipFilled = FALSE, return.type = c("Spectra", "list"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\link{XCMSnExp} object with identified chromatographic peaks.}

\item{msLevel}{\code{integer(1)} defining whether MS1 or MS2 spectra should be
returned. Currently only \code{msLevel = 2} is supported.}

\item{expandRt}{\code{numeric(1)} to expand the retention time range of each
peak by a constant value on each side.}

\item{expandMz}{\code{numeric(1)} to expand the m/z range of each peak by a
constant value on each side.}

\item{ppm}{\code{numeric(1)} to expand the m/z range of each peak (on each side)
by a value dependent on the peak's m/z.}

\item{method}{\code{character(1)} specifying which MS2 spectra should be included.
Defaults to \code{"all"} in which all MS2 spectra within the rt and m/z range
of a chromatographic peak are returned. \code{"closest_rt"} returns the one
MS2 spectrum with the retention time closest to the chromatographic
peak's apex rt. \code{"closest_mz"} returns the MS2 spectrum with the
precursor m/z closest to the chromatographic peak's m/z. \code{"signal"}
returns the MS2 spectrum which total signal is closest to the
chromatographic peak's maximal signal (\code{"maxo"}).}

\item{skipFilled}{\code{logical(1)} whether no spectra for filled-in peaks should
be reported.}

\item{return.type}{\code{character(1)} defining whether the result should be a
\link{Spectra} object or a simple \code{list}. See below for more
information.}
}
\value{
What object is returned depends on the value of \code{return.type}:
\itemize{
\item For \code{return.type = "Spectra"}: a \link{Spectra} object with elements being
\linkS4class{Spectrum} objects. The result objects contains all spectra that
for all peaks. Metadata column \code{"peak_id"} provides the ID of the
respective peak (i.e. its rowname in \link{chromPeaks}).
\item If \code{return.type = "list"}: \code{list} of \code{list}s that are either of length
0 or contain \linkS4class{Spectrum2} object(s) within the m/z-rt range. The
length of the list matches the number of peaks.
}

\description{
Extract (MS2) spectra from an \link{XCMSnExp} object that represent ions within
the rt and m/z range defined by each chromatographic peak (in the same file
/sample in which the peak was detected).
