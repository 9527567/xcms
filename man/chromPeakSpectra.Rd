\title{Extract (MS2) spectra associated with chromatographic peaks}
\usage{
chromPeakSpectra(x, msLevel = 2L, expandRt = 0, expandMz = 0,
  ppm = 0, method = c("all", "closest_rt", "closest_mz", "signal"),
  skipFilled = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{`XCMSnExp` object with identified chromatographic peaks.}

\item{msLevel}{`integer(1)` defining whether MS1 or MS2 spectra should be
returned. Currently only `msLevel = 2` is supported.}

\item{expandRt}{`numeric(1)` to expand the retention time range of each
peak by a constant value on each side.}

\item{expandMz}{`numeric(1)` to expand the m/z range of each peak by a
constant value on each side.}

\item{ppm}{`numeric(1)` to expand the m/z range of each peak (on each side)
by a value dependent on the peak's m/z.}

\item{method}{`character(1)` specifying which MS2 spectra should be included.
Defaults to `"all"` in which all MS2 spectra within the rt and m/z range
of a chromatographic peak are returned. `"closest_rt"` returns the one
MS2 spectrum with the retention time closest to the chromatographic
peak's apex rt. `"closest_mz"` returns the MS2 spectrum with the
precursor m/z closest to the chromatographic peak's m/z. `"signal"`
returns the MS2 spectrum which total signal is closest to the
chromatographic peak's maximal signal (`"maxo"`).}

\item{skipFilled}{`logical(1)` whether no spectra for filled-in peaks should
be reported.}
}
\value{
`list` of `list`s that are either of length 0 or contain
    `Spectrum2` object(s) within the m/z-rt range. The length of the list
    matches the number of peaks.
}
\description{
Extract (MS2) spectra from an `XCMSnExp` object that represent ions within
the rt and m/z range defined by each chromatographic peak (in the same file
/sample in which the peak was detected).
