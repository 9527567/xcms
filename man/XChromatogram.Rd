\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{XChromatogram} object.}

\item{pks}{\code{matrix} with required columns \code{"rt"}, \code{"rtmin"}, \code{"rtmax"},
\code{"into"}, \code{"maxo"} and \code{"sn"}.}

\item{object}{An \code{XChromatogram} object.}

\item{rt}{For \code{chromPeaks}: \code{numeric(2)} defining the retention time range
for which chromatographic peaks should be returned.
For \code{filterRt}: \code{numeric(2)} defining the retention time range to
reduce \code{object} to.}

\item{mz}{For \code{chromPeaks}: \code{numeric(2)} defining the m/z range
for which chromatographic peaks should be returned.
For \code{filterMz}: \code{numeric(2)} defining the m/z range for which
chromatographic peaks should be retained.}

\item{ppm}{For \code{chromPeaks}: \code{numeric(1)} defining a ppm to expand the
provided m/z range}

\item{type}{For \code{chromPeaks}: \code{character(1)} defining which peaks to return
if \code{rt} is provided: \code{"any"} (default) return all peaks that are even
partially overlapping with \code{rt}, \code{"within"} return peaks that are
completely within \code{rt} and \code{"apex_within"} return peaks which apex
is within \code{rt}.
For \code{plot}: what type of plot should be used for the
chromatogram (such as \code{"l"} for lines, \code{"p"} for points etc), see help
of \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}} in the \code{graphics} package for more details.}

\item{value}{For \code{chromPeaks<-}: a numeric \code{matrix} with required columns
\code{"rt"}, \code{"rtmin"}, \code{"rtmax"}, \code{"into"} and \code{"maxo"}.}

\item{col}{For \code{plot}: the color to be used to draw the chromatogram.}

\item{lty}{For \code{plot}: the line type.}

\item{xlab}{For \code{plot}: the x axis label.}

\item{ylab}{For \code{plot}: the y axis label.}

\item{main}{For \code{plot}: an optional title for the plot.}

\item{peakType}{For \code{plot}: \code{character(1)} defining how (and if) identified
chromatographic peak within the chromatogram should be plotted. Options
are \code{"polygon"} (default): draw the peak borders with the \code{peakCol} color
and fill the peak area with the \code{peakBg} color, \code{"point"}: indicate the
peak's apex with a point, \code{"rectangle"}: draw a rectangle around the
identified peak and \code{"none"}: don't draw peaks.}

\item{peakCol}{For \code{plot}: the foreground color for the peaks.
For \code{peakType = "polygon"} and \code{peakType = "rectangle"} this is the
color for the border. Use \code{NA} to not use a foreground color. This
should either be a single color or a vector of colors with the same
length than \code{chromPeaks(x)} has rows.}

\item{peakBg}{For \code{plot}: the background color for the peaks. For
\code{peakType = "polygon"} and \code{peakType = "rectangle"} the peak are or
rectangle will be filled with this color. Use \code{NA} to skip. This should
be either a single color or a vector of colors with the same length than
\code{chromPeaks(x)} has rows.}

\item{peakPch}{For \code{plot}: the point character to be used for
\code{peakType = "point"}. See \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}} in the \code{graphics} package for more
details.}

\item{...}{For \code{plot}: additional parameters to passed to the \code{plot}
function.}
}
\value{
For \code{chromPeaks}: a \code{matrix} with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"rt"}: the retention time of the peak apex.
\item \code{"rtmin"}: the lower peak boundary.
\item \code{"rtmax"}: the upper peak boundary.
\item \code{"into"}: the integrated peak signal (area of the peak).
\item \code{"maxo"}: the maximum intensity of the peak.
Note that the matrix could contain also more columnds depending on the
peak detection method.
}

All other methods return an \code{XChromatogram} object.
}
\description{
The \code{XChromatogram} object allows to store chromatographic data (e.g.
an extracted ion chromatogram) along with identified chromatographic peaks
within that data. The object inherits all functions from the \code{\link[=Chromatogram]{Chromatogram()}}
object in the \code{MSnbase} package.

All functions are described (grouped into topic-related sections) after the
\strong{Arguments} section.
}
\note{
Highlighting the peak area(s) in an \code{XChromatogram} object (\code{plot} with
\code{peakType = "polygon"}) draws a polygon representing the shown chromatogram
from the peak's minimal retention time to the maximal retention time. If the
\code{XChromatogram} was extracted from an \code{\link[=XCMSnExp]{XCMSnExp()}} object with the
\code{\link[=chromatogram]{chromatogram()}} function this might therefore not represent the actual
identified peak area if the m/z range that was used to extract the
chromatogram was larger than the peak's m/z.
}
\section{Creation of objects}{


Objects can be created with the contructor function \code{XChromatogram}.
}

\section{Accessing data}{

\itemize{
\item \code{chromPeaks}, \code{chromPeaks<-}: extract or set the matrix with the
chromatographic peak definitions. Parameter \code{rt} allows to specify a
retention time range for which peaks should be returned along with
parameter \code{type} that defines how \emph{overlapping} is defined (parameter
description for details).
}
}

\section{Plotting and visualizing}{

\itemize{
\item \code{plot} draws the chromatogram and highlights in addition any
chromatographic peaks present in the \code{XChromatogram} (unless
\code{peakType = "none"} was specified). To draw peaks in different colors
a vector of color definitions with length equal to \code{nrow(chromPeaks(x))}
has to be submitted  with \code{peakCol} and/or \code{peakBg} defining one color
for each peak (in the order as peaks are in \code{chromPeaks(x))}. For base
peak chromatograms or total ion chromatograms it might be better to set
\code{peakType = "none"} to avoid generating busy plots.
}
}

\section{Filtering and subsetting}{

\itemize{
\item \code{filterMz} filters the chromatographic peaks within an \code{XChromatogram}, if
a column \code{"mz"} is present in the \code{chromPeaks} matrix. This would be the
case if the \code{XChromatogram} was extracted from an \code{\link[=XCMSnExp]{XCMSnExp()}} object with
the \code{\link[=chromatogram]{chromatogram()}} function. All chromatographic peaks with their m/z
within the m/z range defined by \code{mz} will be retained.
\item \code{filterRt} filters the chromatogram by the provided retention time range.
All eventually present chromatographic peaks with their apex within the
retention time range specified with \code{rt} will be retained.

\examples{

## Create a XChromatogram object
chr <- Chromatogram(rtime = 1:10,
    intensity = c(4, 8, 14, 19, 18, 12, 9, 8, 5, 2))
pks <- matrix(nrow = 1, ncol = 6)
colnames(pks) <- c("rt", "rtmin", "rtmax", "into", "maxo", "sn")
pks[, "rtmin"] <- 2
pks[, "rtmax"] <- 9
pks[, "rt"] <- 4
pks[, "maxo"] <- 19
pks[, "into"] <- 93

xchr <- XChromatogram(chr, pks)
xchr

## Extract the chromatographic peaks
chromPeaks(xchr)

## Plotting of a single XChromatogram object
## o Don't highlight chromatographic peaks
plot(xchr, peakType = "none")

## o Indicate peaks with a polygon
plot(xchr)

## Add a second peak to the data.
pks <- rbind(chromPeaks(xchr), c(7, 7, 10, NA, 15, NA))
chromPeaks(xchr) <- pks

## Plot the peaks in different colors
plot(xchr, peakCol = c("#ff000080", "#0000ff80"),
    peakBg = c("#ff000020", "#0000ff20"))

## Indicate the peaks as rectangles
plot(xchr, peakCol = c("#ff000060", "#0000ff60"), peakBg = NA,
    peakType = "rectangle")

## Filter the XChromatogram by retention time
xchr_sub <- filterRt(xchr, rt = c(4, 6))
xchr_sub
plot(xchr_sub)
